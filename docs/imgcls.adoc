=== Datasets

Ruh either of the below commands to download and prepare datasets:
- Run `link:[data/imgcls/get-data.sh]` -- This includes data augmentations provided by dataset creators.
- Run `link:[data/imgcls/get-data-uniq.sh]`-- This excludes augmentations provided by dataset creators. Maybe useful if you have dynamic augmentations (we do as part of pytorch data loader)

[source,bash]
----
cd data/imgcls
./get-data.sh        # output dirs: hirise and msl
./get-data-uniq.sh   # output dirs: hirise-uniq and msl-uniq
